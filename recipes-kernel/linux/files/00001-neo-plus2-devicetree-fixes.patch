Subject: GPIO Fixes.

Don't have a clue what they were thinking (Suggest the Linux-Sunxi dev
that came up with this device tree spec file look at the schematics
next time...sigh...) but it's now moved to the right GPIO pins for
a NanoPI class device (all of them use this pin on H-series SoC's)
and turned on Heartbeat support for the same...

Subject: Additional GPIO fixes...

This time, the spec file fails to set the pinmux at start and call out
that for the WiFi power sequencing.  It doesn't work on the edge when
the WiFi chip's not enabled even though you specify the kernel kickstart
entry in the DTS.  Correcting...

Stock, the config doesn't turn it on- so we're going to do that rather
than making the userland set everything up (Annoying...)

This includes adding the CTS/RTS for the third UART.  You'd think that
people would transpose this stuff, but NOoooooo...  X-D

Subject: Add rfkill spec for the BT core...

Suspect that the reset behavior is not properly enforced without this
making it just simply NOT work on the distribution.

Helps if you have the node you refer to in the .dts or a .dtsi, doesn't
it?

Subject: GPIO Fixes.

Don't have a clue what they were thinking (Suggest the Linux-Sunxi dev
that came up with this device tree spec file look at the schematics
next time...sigh...) but it's now moved to the right GPIO pins for
a NanoPI class device (all of them use this pin on H-series SoC's)
and turned on Heartbeat support for the same...

PHA Technologies' OE metadata layer and distribution base for their projects (and anyone else that we consult for).

Supports the "Rocko" (2.4) and "Sumo" (2.5) releases of Yocto/OE as a core for build.  

Has the unique distinction, when combined with meta-sunxi, of being the current one-stop shop for OE on the FrendlyElec NanoPI Neo2 and Neo-Plus2 boards, supporting all USB's, the WiFi/Bluetooth on the Neo-Plus2, etc.  These boards are currently otherwise unsupported in OE and only really supported otherwise by FriendlyElec with their modified Ubuntu Core, which may not suit your needs.

Your mileage may vary, but this is offered as a help for those who want to use these boards.
It also provides a lot of other useful recipes in a one-stop-shop type affair.  Enjoy.

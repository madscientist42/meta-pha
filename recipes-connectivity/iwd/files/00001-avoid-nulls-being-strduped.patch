Subject: [PATCH] Don't fail to have a value in the structure for the phy...

The process may leave nulls in the structure for a given wiphy.
Not all devices may reside in the HWDB on a target but have
valid driver modules and firmware.  Push an UNKNOWN when you
can't find vendor or model info rather than lazily keeping
it EMPTY, which will cause follow-on controllers like connman
to CHOKE.
